Sometimes it is really easy to get motivated, and you find yourself wrapped up in a whirlwind of excitement. Other times, it is nearly impossible to figure out how to motivate yourself and you\'re trapped in a death spiral of procrastination. This page contains the best ideas and most useful research on how to get and stay motivated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn\'t going to be some rah-rah, pumped-up motivational speech. (That\'s not my style.) Instead, we\'re going to break down the science behind how to get motivated in the first place and how to stay motivated for the long-run. Whether you\'re trying to figure out how to motivate yourself or how to motivate a team, this page should cover everything you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can click the links below to jump to a particular section or simply scroll down to read everything. At the end of this page, you\'ll find a complete list of all the articles I have written on motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation&lt;/strong&gt; is the experience of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire&quot;&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt; or aversion (&lt;i&gt;you want something, or want to avoid or escape something&lt;/i&gt;). As such, motivation has both an &lt;strong&gt;objective aspect&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;i&gt;a goal or thing you aspire to&lt;/i&gt;) and an &lt;strong&gt;internal&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;subjective aspect&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;i&gt;it is &lt;/i&gt;you&lt;i&gt; that wants the thing or wants it to go away&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At minimum, motivation requires the biological substrate for physical sensations of pleasure and pain; animals can thus want or disdain specific objects based on sense perception and experience. Motivation goes on to include the capacity to form concepts and to reason, which allows humans to be able to surpass this minimum state, with a much greater possible range of desires and aversions. This much greater range is supported by the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will&quot;&gt;choose&lt;/a&gt; one\'s own goals and values, combined with &quot;time horizons&quot; for value achievement that can perhaps encompass years, decades, or longer, and the ability to re-experience past events.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#cite_note-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; Some models treat as important the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation,&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#cite_note-:4-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#cite_note-Ryan,_R._M._2000-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; and motivation is an important topic in work,&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#cite_note-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology&quot;&gt;organizational psychology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Behavior&quot;&gt;administrative organization&lt;/a&gt;, management,&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#cite_note-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_psychology&quot;&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The definition of motivation as experienced desires and aversions highlights the association of&amp;nbsp;motivation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion&quot;&gt;emotion&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed that emotions are automatic appraisals based on subconsciously stored values and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief&quot;&gt;beliefs&lt;/a&gt; about the object.

Asked if that\'s a fair statement during last Saturday\'s Dominance MMA media event in Las Vegas, the 31-year-old Nurmagomedov told CBS Sports he agrees as he readies to make the third defense of his lightweight title.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think so because if you watch on his list of how many fighters [Ferguson] beat, he is the real deal,&quot; Nurmagomedov said. &quot;That\'s why I like this fight because it\'s a real challenge and a real opponent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of people are talking about how he can beat me. This is how you become the greatest fighter. You have to beat a lot of fighters when people are talking about how you are going to lose. This is what makes you a big fighter. That\'s why I love this challenge. I hope we are finally going to fight.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can\'t get enough UFC? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/in-this-corner-with-brian-campbell/id1226601288?mt=2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscribe to my podcast -- State of Combat with Brian Campbell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; -- where I break down everything you need to know in the Octagon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nurmagomedov\'s use of the terms &quot;hope&quot; and &quot;finally&quot; center around the fact that this marks the fifth time since 2015 that UFC has attempted to book the matchup until injuries, illness and bizarre circumstances canceled the fight each time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent cancellation occurred prior to UFC 223 in 2018, nearly two years to the day before they are scheduled to meet again in the same Barclays Center arena. Ferguson, 36, tripped on a cable while working television promotion for the fight and badly injured his knee, forcing UFC to strip him of his interim title.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferguson came back in almost record time and has recorded stoppage wins over Anthony Pettis and Donald Cerrone to reclaim his standing as the No. 1 contender. Given Ferguson\'s resume and danger as a high-volume striker with a strong submission game, many believe Nurmagomedov can take one step closer to MMA immortality with a win while further fueling the idea he might be able to retire unbeaten over the next few years on his own terms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his incredible unbeaten record and the fact that judges have scored just one round against him in his UFC career, Nurmagomedov claims that entering G.O.A.T. territory is something he isn\'t concerned with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To talk about, \'Oh, I\'m the greatest of all time.\' I don\'t know,&quot; Nurmagomedov said. &quot;We have Jon Jones, Fedor [Emelianenko], we have Demetrious Johnson, we have Henry Cejudo, [Daniel] DC [Cormier], Anderson Silva -- a lot of guys. One of the best? Maybe, but I don\'t want to talk about I\'m the greatest of all-time. I\'m one of the best.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prompted for one word to describe exactly what his fight with Ferguson will look like after being forced to wait five years to see it finally take place, Nurmagomedov predicted how it would end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It\'s going to look like I\'m focused on the finish,&quot; he said. &quot;I\'m going to finish him in the second or third round.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-03-12 23:08:45'),

However, it doesn&rsquo;t appear in the writings of Archimedes.&amp;nbsp;[/efn_note]&amp;nbsp;[efn_note]&amp;nbsp;According to Greek historian, Plutarch, Archimedes was killed whilst the city of Syracuse was under siege by the Romans. Whilst solving for a solution to a mathematical problem, a Roman soldier commanded Archimedes to meet a Roman general, but Archimedes refused saying &ldquo;Do not disturb my circles,&rdquo; in reference to his mathematical drawings. The angered Roman soldier then slaughtered Archimedes with his sword.&amp;nbsp;[/efn_note]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His insights from this experiment would later be formalized as &lt;i&gt;Archimedes&rsquo; principle&lt;/i&gt;&mdash;a law of physics fundamental to fluid mechanics&mdash;and today, aside from inventing the word &ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo; Archimedes is regarded as the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, &lt;i&gt;Archimedes&rsquo; principle &lt;/i&gt;contains useful analogies that could provide answers to an important question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we fail in life and work?&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-03-12 23:10:10'),

Although it did not yield any hits, it sold a respectable 500,000 copies and established Tupac as an uncompromising social commentator on songs such as &quot;Brenda\'s Got a Baby&quot; &mdash; which narrates an underaged mother\'s fall into destitution &mdash; and &quot;Soulja\'s Story,&quot; which controversially spoke of &quot;blasting&quot; a police officer and &quot;droppin\' the cop.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The song was cited as a motivation for a real-life cop killing by a teenage car thief called Ronald Ray Howard and was condemned by the then-U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle. &quot;There is absolutely no reason for a record like this to be published,&quot; Quayle said. &quot;It has no place in our society.&quot; With those words, Tupac\'s notoriety was guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\'Strictly 4 My Niggaz\'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tupac&rsquo;s second album, &lt;i&gt;Strictly 4 My Niggaz&lt;/i&gt;, dropped in February 1993. It continued in the same socially conscious vein as his debut. On the gold-certified single &quot;Keep Ya Head Up,&quot; he empathized with &quot;my sisters on the welfare,&quot; encouraging them to &quot;please don\'t cry, dry your eyes, never let up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The album featured contributions from Tupac\'s stepbrother, Mopreme. Mopreme became a member of the hip-hop group Thug Life, which Tupac started and which released the album &lt;i&gt;Thug Life: Volume 1&lt;/i&gt; in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\'Me Against the World\'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Tupac\'s third solo album came out on March 14, 1995, he was in jail. Its title, &lt;i&gt;Me Against the World&lt;/i&gt;, could not have been more apt. It reached No. 1 in the Billboard 200 chart and is considered by many to be his magnum opus &mdash; &quot;by and large a work of pain, anger and burning desperation&quot; wrote Cheo H. Coker at &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was vulnerability, too &mdash; lead single, &quot;Dear Mama,&quot; was a tear-jerking tribute to his mother, Afeni, that hit number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\'All Eyez on Me\'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tupac\'s debut for Death Row, the double-length album &lt;i&gt;All Eyez on Me&lt;/i&gt;, came out in February 1996. With his new hip-hop group Outlawz debuting on the album, &lt;i&gt;All Eyez on Me&lt;/i&gt; was an unapologetic celebration of the thug lifestyle, eschewing socially conscious lyrics in favor of gangsta-funk hedonism and menace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biography.com/people/dr-dre-507628&quot;&gt;Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt;, who had pioneered g-funk with NWA, produced the album\'s first single, &quot;California Love&quot; &mdash; which went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and remains Tupac\'s best-known song. The third single from the album, &quot;How Do You Want It,&quot; also reached No. 1. Within two months of its release, &lt;i&gt;All Eyez on Me&lt;/i&gt; had been certified five-times double-platinum. It would eventually become diamond certified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\'How Do U Want It\'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Released as a single in June 1996, &ldquo;How Do You Want It&rdquo; was more famous for its B track, &ldquo;Hit &lsquo;Em Up,&rdquo; which aired Tupac&rsquo;s West Coast feud with East Coast Bad Boy rivals. On the inflammatory song, Tupac spat venom at artists including Biggie Smalls, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biography.com/people/lil-kim-21254313&quot;&gt;Lil Kim&lt;/a&gt;, Junior M.A.F.I.A. and Prodigy of Mobb Deep. The track seemed to chillingly presage Tupac&rsquo;s death and the ensuing conspiracy theories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Grab ya Glocks, when you see Tupac; Call the cops, when you see Tupac, uh; Who shot me, but ya punks didn\'t finish; Now ya bout to feel the wrath of a menace,&rdquo; he rapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\'Don Killuminati: The Seven Day Theory\'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tupac\'s fifth album, &lt;i&gt;Don Killuminati: The Seven Day Theory&lt;/i&gt;, was released in November 1996, just eight weeks after his death. It also reached No. 1 on the charts. Tupac recorded a total of six studio albums released posthumously, up to and including &lt;i&gt;Pac\'s Life&lt;/i&gt; in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poems and Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Tupac became a rapper, he wrote poetry. &ldquo;The world moves fast and it would rather pass u by / than 2 stop and c what makes you cry,&quot; is one verse he wrote as a teenager that would eventually be published in the 2000 book, &lt;i&gt;The Rose that Grew from Concrete&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movies Starring Tupac&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with his music, Tupac had appeared in several films by the time of his death, among them starring roles alongside &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biography.com/people/janet-jackson-9542443&quot;&gt;Janet Jackson&lt;/a&gt; in 1993\'s&lt;i&gt; Poetic Justice&lt;/i&gt; and Mickey Rourke in 1996\'s &lt;i&gt;Bullet&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tupac\'s Wife and Girlfriend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tupac married Keisha Morris in 1995 while he was still in prison; the couple had met several months earlier at a nightclub when Morris was 20 and Tupac was 21.

But, as philosophers have noted for centuries, things get complicated fairly quickly. Consider, for example, the question: What is real? Is the coke bottle on my desk real? Are the trees outside my window real? What about the number pi? What about the pain from the slight cut on my finger? As one ponders these questions, they quickly give rise to the question of how do I come to know things in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separating the &quot;How&quot; from the &quot;What&quot; of Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With some reflection, it becomes clear that, at least to some extent, what is real for me depends in part on how I come to know things. For example, my perceptual, cognitive background structures allow me to experience and understand the Coke bottle on my desk in a particular way; different perceptual or cognitive background structures would result in a different reality. This point was well made in the 1980 film, &lt;i&gt;The Gods Must Be Crazy&lt;/i&gt;, which tells the story of the dramatic impact a Coke bottle dropped by a passing airplane had on an isolated tribe in the Kalahari Desert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tribesmen interpreted the bottle as a gift from the gods, and the film tracked how that meaning permeated the tribe and impacted its members. This brief example highlights the two broadest angles philosophers take regarding knowledge, which is that of &ldquo;epistemology&rdquo; and &ldquo;ontology.&rdquo; Ontology refers to the question of reality and is about determining what can be said to really exist in the world. In contrast, epistemology refers to how we humans know things. A &ldquo;theory of knowledge&rdquo; would explain what knowledge was, how humans could come to know things, what truly existed in the world, and the complicated relationship between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Basic Approach to Conceptualizing Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the oldest and most venerable traditions in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/philosophy&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; of knowledge characterizes knowledge as &ldquo;justified true &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/spirituality&quot;&gt;belief&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;. Although not all philosophers agree that &ldquo;justified true belief&rdquo; does in fact adequately characterize the nature of knowledge, it remains the most dominant conception of knowledge. Thus, for many, knowledge consists of three elements: 1) a human belief or mental representation about a state of affairs that 2) accurately corresponds to the actual state of affairs (i.e., is true) and that the representation is 3) legitimized by logical and empirical factors. To be clear about this last element, it is not considered knowledge if, for example, a child, when asked about the molecular nature of water, says &ldquo;H 2 0&rdquo; simply because he is parroting what he has heard. In contrast, a chemist who answers &ldquo;H 2 0&rdquo; has knowledge because his representation is meaningfully networked and justified by much prior knowledge and careful deductive work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justification, thus, is central to this idea of knowledge. The question of what kind of justification is necessary to constitute knowledge is the focus of much reflection and debate among philosophers. Three prominent approaches that have been taken in an attempt to articulate how justifiable beliefs are formed are: 1) foundationalism, which attempts to articulate foundationally true beliefs, from which other conclusions can be derived; 2) coherentism, which argues that knowledge consists of systems and must be evaluated on the degree to which the system has logical coherence that corresponds to external facts; and 3) reliablism, which argues that there are good and bad ways to develop beliefs, and that justified beliefs are those beliefs that are formed based on good and reliable methods. Although philosophers disagree on which is most fundamental, most agree that justification can and should involve all of these elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kinds of Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philosophers often divide knowledge up into three broad domains: personal, procedural, and propositional. Personal knowledge relates to firsthand experience, idiosyncratic preferences, and autobiographical facts. Procedural knowledge refers to knowledge how to do something, such as how to play basketball or ride a bike. Propositional knowledge refers to general truth claims about the world and how we know it. An important difference between philosophy and psychology can be seen in these various kinds of knowledge. Whereas philosophers have generally been concerned with general propositional knowledge, psychologists have generally concerned themselves with how people acquire personal and procedural knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ways of Knowing: Empirical and Rational&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By what mechanisms do we come to achieve knowledge? The two most dominant answers to this question in philosophy have come from the rationalists and the empiricists. The rationalists argue that we utilize reason to arrive at deductive conclusions about the most justifiable claims. Rationalists tend to think more in terms of propositions, deriving truths from argument, and building systems of logic that correspond to the order in nature. Rene&rsquo; Descartes and Immanuel Kant are some of the most famous rationalists, in contrast to John Locke and David Hume, who are famous empiricists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empiricists tend to argue that the most basic knowledge we achieve about the world comes from our senses, the direct observations that we make about the world. The distinction between the rationalists and empiricists in some ways parallels the modern distinction between philosophy and science. As the scientific method emerged and became increasingly distinct from the discipline of philosophy, the fundamental distinction between the two was that science was constructed on empirical observation, whereas the initial traditions in philosophy (e.g., Aristotle) were grounded more in utilizing reason to build systems of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-03-23 13:58:03'),
(21, 41, 7, 'Recent System of Knoweledge', '1584968333_knoweledge2.jpg', '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern versus Post-Modern Views on the Nature of Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The birth of science gave rise to the Enlightenment, and arguably the defining feature of the Enlightenment was the belief that humans could use reason and scientific observation and experimentation to develop increasingly accurate models of the world. Such models were conceived to be &ldquo;true&rdquo; in the sense that they described ontology (the way the world was) in a manner that was separate from subjective impressions. The Periodic Table of Elements is a great example of the success of the idea that nature can be objectively described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in many disciplines, especially in the social sciences and humanities, since the 1960s there has been an increasing chorus of voices that challenge the conception of scientific knowledge as being a pristine, objective map of the one true reality. Instead, many have argued that human knowledge is inherently based on context, that is created in part by the way the human mind organizes and constructs perceptions and also by the way the social context legitimizes certain ideas in various historical and political times, and that these elements cannot be completely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/divorce&quot;&gt;divorced&lt;/a&gt; from our &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;. These scholars fall under the broad term &ldquo;postmodernism&rdquo; to highlight the contrast in assumptions regarding the nature of knowledge in contrast to the modernist assumptions of the Enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recent Systems of Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although several modern philosophers seriously doubt whether a successful theory of knowledge can be built, there nonetheless have been identifiable developments in mapping knowledge domains and attempting to develop educational systems that begin with the basic structure and domains of knowledge. One such development has been the development of &lsquo;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_knowledge_(IB_course)&quot;&gt;Theory of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo; International Baccalaureate Diploma Program that teaches students about the ways of knowing and the domains of knowledge such that they can approach many different areas of inquiry with a grounding in how knowledge systems are build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second system that has been gaining some notoriety lately is that of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bighistoryproject.com/bhplive&quot;&gt;Big History&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to create a macro-level perspective of humans since the beginning of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My framework, the Tree of Knowledge System, is an approach that has elements in common with both of these approaches. The ToK System carries as a unique feature the proposition that reality as an unfolding wave of energy and information that has developed in four major phases, Matter, Life, Mind and Culture. As part of a new unified view, I argue that it solve the long standing problem of psychology and thus offers a new way to bridge philosophy and psychology and integrate human knowledge systems in to a more coherent holistic view.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-03-23 13:58:53'),

(25, 41, 9, 'Man Out of Time and the inheritance of suffering', '1584974893_outoftime.jpg', '&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Bishop&rsquo;s latest novel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38943842-man-out-of-time&quot;&gt;Man Out of Time&lt;/a&gt; (Hachette, 2018), is a disturbing read. It is also a sophisticated work, particularly in terms of the way the author has managed narrative temporality &ndash; that is, the relation between story and time. Other novelists and aspiring writers would do well to look closely at what Bishop has achieved here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Literary scholar Mark Currie &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17071747-the-unexpected?from_search=true&quot;&gt;has suggested&lt;/a&gt; that stories help us to reconcile what we expect with what we experience. Narrative fiction, he argues, can help us to think about the way that we anticipate, or sometimes fail to anticipate, what lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Man Out of Time opens on a chapter that follows the central character, Leon, through some of his last hours of life. It is illustrated by photographs Leon has taken of a landscape marked by humans but empty of human form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leon&rsquo;s disengagement with the world is clear, and his death is foreshadowed by references to the multiple scripts he has taken out for painkillers using false names, and by an intention to make &ldquo;no error this time&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next chapter, the adult Stella will take a phone call from her mother, Frances. Leon has gone missing. &ldquo;Has he made contact?&rdquo; Frances asks Stella. He has not, and probably will not. He is most likely already dead via suicide. The weight of this knowledge sits heavily on the reader, and on the character Stella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bishop&rsquo;s achievement in Man Out of Time is an affecting portrait of a family rocked by the patriarchal figure&rsquo;s long-term depression. In particular, its focus is on the parent/child relationship and because of this, it is an interesting companion piece to Jessie Cole&rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/staying-a-memoir&quot;&gt;Staying&lt;/a&gt; (2018), and to Adam Haslett&rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40727599-imagine-me-gone?from_search=true&quot;&gt;Imagine Me Gone&lt;/a&gt; (2016).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depressive illness has a particular relation to time and to tense. It is as if the depressive&rsquo;s perception takes place outside of ordinary continuity, unharnessed from normative understandings of cause and effect. &ldquo;In what way does one thing lead to the next?&rdquo; asks Leon. &ldquo;He struggled with this connection&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shifting perspectives and tenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parent/child relationships, in contrast, are very often concerned with how a parent creates and influences a child&rsquo;s future. While Man Out of Time is a story largely told in retrospect &ndash; after the opening chapters, we move backwards in time to Stella&rsquo;s childhood and adolescence, and to Leon and his family&rsquo;s early experiences with his diagnosis and treatment &ndash; the novel&rsquo;s key preoccupation is inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will the suffering that Leon has experienced &ndash; as well as caused &ndash; be repeated by his daughter in the future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the novel, Bishop shifts from using third person to second, and from past tense to present, to get us closer to Leon&rsquo;s perspective while he&rsquo;s in hospital receiving treatment: &ldquo;One morning you are wheeled from your room into another smaller room&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is description largely devoid of embellishments. After Leon&rsquo;s electric shock therapy, Bishop sharply demonstrates Leon&rsquo;s profound loss of narrative desire:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When you wake it is to think; No &hellip; No to the hum of the fridge. No to dripping umbrellas &hellip; No to jazz. No to sequins and leopard print. No to the banal. No to the false. No to verisimilitude.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;shutterstock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the chapter moves towards its conclusion, the author shifts our attention to a post-hospital phase that is future-oriented, but also just as likely to be shot through with discontinuity:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Afterwards. You are told before the treatment what you cannot do afterwards &ndash; because of your memory, the problems with memory that arise of the consequence of this particular treatment. One is not to drive a car.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, Leon&rsquo;s disconnection from an ordinary life narrative and from time means that which lies ahead is deeply anticipated in this book &ndash; for Stella, for Leon and for Frances. The future will come regardless. It is coming now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a period of convalescence at home, Leon acknowledges &ldquo;a terrible sense that anything and everything that might possibly go wrong in [Stella&rsquo;s] life would always be construed as his fault&rdquo;. But Stella is deeply loyal to him, despite his transgressions, including his fleeting sexual abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menacingly, during her adolescence, Leon tells Stella that everything she ever writes will in some way be about him. And perhaps the novel itself, which is framed as Stella&rsquo;s invention, is evidence of this. Even well beyond the (by-then) acknowledged fact of Leon&rsquo;s suicide, the play between the foreseeable and the unexpected is a key source of tension for Stella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many stories move from not knowing to knowing, or from uncertainty towards explanation, this is not one of those novels. If anything, as Currie would phrase it, &ldquo;progress is a process of increasing bafflement.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second to last chapter, years after her father&rsquo;s death, Bishop describes a dream the adult Stella has, in which she is confused by an imagined set of directions from Google Maps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;She did not know which path to take. She had taken neither path before. There was nothing to indicate whether the slower path would be more interesting, or whether it would simply be more tiring, and because she had never been to the place she was heading towards, there was no knowing whether the quicker route would deliver her faster to a good and pleasurable thing, or whether the experience to which her route led would be bad or unwelcome or just dull &ndash; a destination that was not so necessary after all &ndash; in which case she&rsquo;d be better off taking the means without end: the slower, perhaps prettier path that she may or may not be about to take, now, as she stands at her open door, watching the pulsing signal that represents her real self, and wondering where it might go.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his critical work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17071747-the-unexpected?from_search=true&quot;&gt;The Unexpected&lt;/a&gt; (2013), Currie has argued that any understanding of how temporality works in contemporary narrative needs to take in what he calls a philosophy of surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is instructive, in this context, that Bishop concludes a book very much slowed and distorted by Leon&rsquo;s out-of-timeness with this part hopeful, part anxiety-ridden focus on the unforeseen.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-03-23 15:28:26'),

It occurs naturally but rarely, and despite the best efforts of Tesla and others, the exact origin of the phenomenon remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although reported sightings are most common during storms and other unsettled weather, ball lighting has been observed during periods of absolute calm. It has also been spotted in some pretty screwy places: hovering over a kitchen stove, following a car down a street and, most famously, flying alongside aircraft during World War II. Allied pilots, mistaking the glowing spheres for the lights of enemy aircraft, referred to them as &quot;foo fighters.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I never saw fire balls,&quot; Tesla wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20051222121927/http://tfcbooks.com/tesla/wireless01.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Electrical World and Engineer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on March 5, 1904, &quot;but as compensation for my disappointment I succeeded later in determining the mode of their formation and producing them artificially,&quot; He regarded ball lightning as a manifestation of a larger phenomenon: &quot;[T]his planet, with all its appalling immensity, is to electric currents virtually no more than a small metal ball.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla hoped to use this phenomenon to transmit through the air not only telegraph and voice signals, but electrical power itself. Contemporary reports say Tesla used a generating apparatus to &lt;a href=&quot;http://homepage.ntlworld.com/forgottenfutures/tesla/tesla.htm&quot;&gt;create electrical balls&lt;/a&gt; about 1&frac12; inches in diameter and played with them to wow onlookers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/&quot;&gt;Tesla is perhaps better known&lt;/a&gt; for his pioneering work on alternating current as the basis for an electrical-distribution grid.

He spent many of his holidays traveling in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Latin-America&quot;&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt;, and his observations of the great poverty of the masses contributed to his eventual conclusion that the only solution lay in violent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/revolution-politics&quot;&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt;.

That trip, which began on a motorcycle they called &ldquo;the Powerful&rdquo; (which broke down and was abandoned early in the journey), took them from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Argentina&quot;&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Chile&quot;&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Peru&quot;&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Colombia&quot;&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, and on to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Venezuela&quot;&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, from which Guevara traveled alone on to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Miami-Florida&quot;&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, returning to Argentina by plane. During the trip Guevara kept a journal that was posthumously published under his family&rsquo;s guidance as &lt;i&gt;The Motorcycle Diaries: Notes on a Latin American Journey&lt;/i&gt; (2003) and adapted to film as &lt;i&gt;The Motorcycle Diaries&lt;/i&gt; (2004).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1953 Guevara went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Guatemala-City&quot;&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jacobo-Arbenz&quot;&gt;Jacobo Arbenz&lt;/a&gt; headed a progressive regime that was attempting to bring about a social revolution. (About that time Guevara acquired his nickname, from a verbal mannerism of Argentines who punctuate their speech with the interjection &lt;i&gt;che&lt;/i&gt;.) The overthrow of the Arbenz regime in 1954 in a coup supported by the U.S. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Central-Intelligence-Agency&quot;&gt;Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)&lt;/a&gt; persuaded Guevara that the United States would always oppose progressive leftist governments. This became the cornerstone of his plans to bring about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/socialism&quot;&gt;socialism&lt;/a&gt; by means of a worldwide revolution. It was in Guatemala that Guevara became a dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Marxism&quot;&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription.&lt;a href=&quot;https://subscription.britannica.com/subscribe?partnerCode=BP_House_USD_C&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cuban Revolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;He left Guatemala for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Mexico-City&quot;&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, where he met the Cuban brothers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fidel-Castro&quot;&gt;Fidel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Raul-Castro&quot;&gt;Ra&uacute;l Castro&lt;/a&gt;, political exiles who were preparing an attempt to overthrow the dictatorship of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fulgencio-Batista&quot;&gt;Fulgencio Batista&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Cuba&quot;&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. Guevara joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fidel-Castro&quot;&gt;Fidel Castro&rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/26th-of-July-Movement&quot;&gt;26th of July Movement&lt;/a&gt;, which landed a force of 81 men (including Guevara) in the Cuban province of Oriente on December 2, 1956. Immediately detected by Batista&rsquo;s army, they were almost wiped out. The few survivors, including the wounded Guevara, reached the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Sierra-Maestra&quot;&gt;Sierra Maestra&lt;/a&gt;, where they became the nucleus of a guerrilla army. The rebels slowly gained in strength, seizing weapons from Batista&rsquo;s forces and winning support and new recruits. Guevara had initially come along as the force&rsquo;s doctor, but he had also trained in weapons use, and he became one of Castro&rsquo;s most-trusted aides. Indeed, the complex Guevara, though trained as a healer, also, on occasion, acted as the executioner (or ordered the execution) of suspected traitors and deserters. He recorded the two years spent overthrowing Batista&rsquo;s government in &lt;i&gt;Pasajes de la guerra revolucionaria&lt;/i&gt; (1963; &lt;i&gt;Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War&lt;/i&gt;, 1968).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.britannica.com/s:700x500/53/195353-050-C5EFAA74/Che-Guevara.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Che Guevara&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Che Guevara&lt;/strong&gt;Che Guevara.Yutaka Nagata/UN Photo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Castro&rsquo;s victorious troops entered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Havana&quot;&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt; on January 8, 1959, Guevara served for several months at La Caba&ntilde;a prison, where he oversaw the executions of individuals deemed to be enemies of the revolution. Guevara became a Cuban citizen, as prominent in the newly established Marxist government as he had been in the revolutionary army, representing Cuba on many commercial missions. He also became well known in the West for his opposition to all forms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/imperialism&quot;&gt;imperialism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/neocolonialism&quot;&gt;neocolonialism&lt;/a&gt; and for his attacks on U.S. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/foreign-policy&quot;&gt;foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;. He served as chief of the Industrial Department of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform, president of the National Bank of Cuba (famously demonstrating his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disdain&quot;&gt;disdain&lt;/a&gt; for capitalism by signing currency simply &ldquo;Che&rdquo;), and minister of industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the early 1960s, he defined Cuba&rsquo;s policies and his own views in many speeches and writings, notably &ldquo;El socialismo y el hombre en Cuba&rdquo; (1965; &ldquo;Man and Socialism in Cuba,&rdquo; 1967)&mdash;an examination of Cuba&rsquo;s new brand of communism&mdash;and a highly influential manual, &lt;i&gt;La guerra de guerrillas&lt;/i&gt; (1960; &lt;i&gt;Guerrilla Warfare&lt;/i&gt;, 1961). The last book included Guevara&rsquo;s delineation of his &lt;i&gt;foco&lt;/i&gt; theory (&lt;i&gt;foquismo&lt;/i&gt;), a doctrine of revolution in Latin America drawn from the experience of the Cuban Revolution and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predicated&quot;&gt;predicated&lt;/a&gt; on three main tenets: 1) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/guerrilla&quot;&gt;guerrilla&lt;/a&gt; forces are capable of defeating the army; 2) all the conditions for making a revolution do not have to be in place to begin a revolution, because the rebellion itself can bring them about; and 3) the countryside of underdeveloped Latin America is suited for armed combat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guevara expounded a vision of a new socialist citizen who would work for the good of society rather than for personal profit, a notion he embodied through his own hard work. Often he slept in his office, and, in support of the volunteer labour program he had organized, he spent his day off working in a sugarcane field. He grew increasingly disheartened, however, as Cuba became a client state of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Soviet-Union&quot;&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, and he felt betrayed by the Soviets when they removed their missiles from the island without consulting the Cuban leadership during the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/event/Cuban-missile-crisis&quot;&gt; Cuban missile crisis of 1962&lt;/a&gt;. Guevara began looking to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/China&quot;&gt;People&rsquo;s Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; and its leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mao-Zedong&quot;&gt;Mao Zedong&lt;/a&gt; for support and as an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://safe.britannica.com/safeimages/alt_300x90.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Subscribe Today!&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Che Guevara&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUICK FACTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.britannica.com/s:300x300/44/11344-050-9456729E/Che-Guevara.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Che Guevara&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Che-Guevara/images-videos&quot;&gt;View Media Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BORN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 14, 1928&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Rosario-Argentina&quot;&gt;Rosario&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Argentina&quot;&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;October 1967 (aged 39)&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Bolivia&quot;&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROLE IN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/event/Cuban-Revolution&quot;&gt;Cuban Revolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Congo, Bolivia, And Death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 1964 Guevara traveled to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/New-York-City&quot;&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, where he condemned U.S. intervention in Cuban affairs and incursions into Cuban airspace in an address to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-Nations-General-Assembly&quot;&gt;United Nations General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. Back in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Cuba&quot;&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, increasingly disillusioned with the direction of the Cuban social experiment and its reliance on the Soviets, Guevara began focusing his attention on fostering revolution elsewhere. After April 1965 he dropped out of public life. His movements and whereabouts for the next two years remained secret. It was later learned that he had traveled to what is now the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Democratic-Republic-of-the-Congo&quot;&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt; with other Cuban guerrilla fighters in what proved to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/futile&quot;&gt;futile&lt;/a&gt; attempt to help the Patrice Lumumba Battalion, which was fighting a civil war there. During that period Guevara resigned his ministerial position in the Cuban government and renounced his Cuban citizenship. After the failure of his efforts in the Congo, he fled first to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Tanzania&quot;&gt;Tanzania &lt;/a&gt;and then to a safe house in a village near &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Prague&quot;&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the autumn of 1966 Guevara went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-Bolivia&quot;&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, incognito (beardless and bald), to create and lead a guerrilla group in the region of Santa Cruz. After some initial combat successes, Guevara and his guerrilla band found themselves constantly on the run from the Bolivian army. On October 8, 1967, the group was almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/annihilated&quot;&gt;annihilated&lt;/a&gt; by a special detachment of the Bolivian army aided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Central-Intelligence-Agency&quot;&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; advisers. Guevara, who was wounded in the attack, was captured and shot. Before his body disappeared to be secretly buried, his hands were cut off; they were preserved in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/science/formaldehyde&quot;&gt;formaldehyde&lt;/a&gt; so that his fingerprints could be used to confirm his identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1995 one of Guevara&rsquo;s biographers, Jon Lee Anderson, announced that he had learned that Guevara and several of his comrades had been buried in a mass grave near the town of Vallegrande in central Bolivia. In 1997 a skeleton that was believed be that of the revolutionary and the remains of his six comrades were disinterred and transported to Cuba to be interred in a massive memorial and monument in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Santa-Clara-Cuba&quot;&gt;Santa Clara&lt;/a&gt; on the 30th anniversary of Guevara&rsquo;s death. (On the 80th anniversary of his birth, another memorial to Guevara, a statue, was dedicated in his hometown, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Rosario-Argentina&quot;&gt;Rosario&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Argentina&quot;&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, in 2008, after decades of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acrimonious&quot;&gt;acrimonious&lt;/a&gt; debate among its citizens over his legacy.) In 2007 a French and a Spanish journalist made a case that the body brought to Cuba was not actually Guevara&rsquo;s. The Cuban government refuted the claim, citing scientific evidence from 1997 (including dental structure) that, it said, proved that the remains were those of Guevara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Che The Icon: Legacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guevara would live on as a powerful symbol, bigger in some ways in death than in life. He was almost always referenced simply as Che&mdash;like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elvis-Presley&quot;&gt;Elvis Presley&lt;/a&gt;, so popular an icon that his first name alone was identifier enough. Many on the political right condemned him as brutal, cruel, murderous, and all too willing to employ violence to reach revolutionary ends. On the other hand, Guevara&rsquo;s romanticized image as a revolutionary loomed especially large for the generation of young leftist radicals in western Europe and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/North-America&quot;&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; in the turbulent 1960s. Almost from the time of Guevara&rsquo;s death, his whiskered face adorned T-shirts and posters. Framed by a red-star-studded beret and long hair, his face frozen in a resolute expression, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/iconic&quot;&gt;iconic&lt;/a&gt; image was derived from a photo taken by Cuban photographer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alberto-Korda&quot;&gt;Alberto Korda&lt;/a&gt; on March 5, 1960, at a ceremony for those killed when a ship that had brought arms to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Havana&quot;&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt; exploded. At first the image of Che was worn as a statement of rebellion, then as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/epitome&quot;&gt;epitome&lt;/a&gt; of radical chic, and, with the passage of time, as a kind of abstract logo whose original significance may even have been lost on its wearer, though for some he remains an enduring inspiration for revolutionary action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.britannica.com/s:700x500/09/185409-050-49A64B72/Demonstrator-flag-image-Cuban-Che-Guevara-Bangkok-2010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Guevara, Che&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guevara, Che&lt;/strong&gt;Demonstrator carrying a flag bearing an image of Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara at an antigovernment rally in Bangkok, 2010.David Longstreath/AP Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-03-23 15:34:14');

(28, 41, 10, 'Arnold  Schwarzenegger', '1584974315_arnold.jpg', '&lt;p&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger first gained fame as a bodybuilder, using that as a launching point to become a huge Hollywood star and, later, the governor of California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO WAS ARNOLD?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger was born on July 30, 1947, near Graz, Austria. He rose to fame as the world\'s top bodybuilder, launching a career that would make him a giant Hollywood star via films like &lt;i&gt;Conan the Barbarian&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Terminator&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Total Recall&lt;/i&gt;. After years of blockbuster movie roles, Schwarzenegger went into politics, becoming governor of California in 2003. He returned to the big screen after leaving office in 2011, finding success with &lt;i&gt;The Expendables&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;franchise and a return to the &lt;i&gt;Terminator&lt;/i&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger was born on July 30, 1947, near Graz, Austria. Schwarzenegger\'s childhood was far from ideal. His father, Gustav, was an alcoholic police chief and one-time member of the Nazi Party, who clearly favored Arnold\'s brother over his gangly, seemingly less athletic younger son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gustav is reported to have beaten and intimidated Arnold and, when he could, pitted his two boys against one another. He also ridiculed Schwarzenegger\'s early dreams of becoming a bodybuilder. &quot;It was a very uptight feeling at home,&quot; Schwarzenegger later recalled. So uptight and uncomfortable, in fact, that Schwarzenegger would later refuse to attend the funeral of his father, who died in 1972, or his brother, who was killed in a car crash in 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bodybuilding Champion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an escape, Arnold turned to the movies, in particular those of Reg Park, a bodybuilder and star in B-level Hercules movies. The films also helped propel Schwarzenegger\'s own obsession with America, and the future he felt awaited him there. Getting to his new country was the issue. Schwarzenegger found his answer in Joe Weider, the man behind the International Federation of Body Building, an organization that sponsored contests such Mr. Universe and Mr. Olympia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weider loved Schwarzenegger\'s bravado, sense of humor, and the potential he saw in the young bodybuilder. Weider\'s instincts couldn\'t have been more dead-on. In all, Schwarzenegger would win an unprecedented five Mr. Universe titles and six Mr. Olympia crowns during his bodybuilding career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equally significant, Schwarzenegger, who had immigrated to the United States in 1968, helped propel the sport into the mainstream, culminating in the 1977 documentary, &lt;i&gt;Pumping Iron&lt;/i&gt;, which tells the tale of Schwarzenegger\'s defense of his Mr. Olympia crown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1976&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo: Jack Mitchell/Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Star: \'Conan,\' \'The Terminator,\' \'Total Recall\' and Beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his ascension to the top of the bodybuilding world, it was only a matter of time before&amp;nbsp;Schwarzenegger would&amp;nbsp;move over to the big screen.&amp;nbsp;After a few small parts, Schwarzenegger received a Golden Globe Award for Best Newcomer for his performance in &lt;i&gt;Stay Hungry&lt;/i&gt; (1976).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his immense physical strength and size, Schwarzenegger was a natural for action films. He became a leading figure in several popular 1980s action movies, including &lt;i&gt;Conan the Barbarian&lt;/i&gt; (1982) and its sequel, &lt;i&gt;Conan the Destroyer&lt;/i&gt; (1984). Schwarzenegger also starred as a deadly machine from the future in &lt;i&gt;The Terminator&lt;/i&gt; (1984), and later reprised the role for&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&lt;/i&gt; (1991) and &lt;i&gt;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&lt;/i&gt; (2003).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional action flicks from the actor\'s heyday include &lt;i&gt;Commando&lt;/i&gt; (1985), &lt;i&gt;Predator&lt;/i&gt; (1987), &lt;i&gt;The Running Man&lt;/i&gt; (1987), &lt;i&gt;Total Recall&lt;/i&gt; (1990) and &lt;i&gt;True Lies&lt;/i&gt; (1994). He also used his oversized physique to comedic effect in &lt;i&gt;Twins&lt;/i&gt; (1988) and &lt;i&gt;Kindergarten Cop&lt;/i&gt; (1990).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marriage to Maria Shriver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off-screen Schwarzenegger continued his remarkable story, marrying into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biography.com/news/kennedy-family-members&quot;&gt;Kennedy family&lt;/a&gt; in 1986 by tying the knot with Maria Owings Shriver, daughter of Eunice Kennedy Shriver and her husband R. Sargent Shriver. The couple announced their decision to separate in May 2011, after&amp;nbsp;Schwarzenegger\'s acknowledgment that he\'d fathered a baby with a member of the family\'s household staff.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwarzenegger and Shriver have four children: Katherine, Christina, Patrick and Christopher. Patrick followed his dad into the acting business, appearing in several films as a child before taking a leading role in the 2018 teen tear-jerker &lt;i&gt;Midnight Sun&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governor of California&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Schwarzenegger again showed his resolve to succeed when he threw his hat into the ring for the California governor\'s race and won a seat in a special election. In a state that was mired in severe budget woes, the newly elected Republican governor promised to bring economic stability to his adopted state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, Schwarzenegger brought his own unique brand of confidence to his new job. &quot;If they don\'t have the guts, I call them \'girlie-men,\'&quot; he said of Democrats, early in his first term. &quot;They should go back to the table and fix the budget.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, as governor, Schwarzenegger worked to improve the state\'s financial situation, promote new businesses and protect the environment. In 2006, he easily won his bid for re-election. Throughout his political career, Schwarzenegger credited former U.S. President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biography.com/people/ronald-reagan-9453198&quot;&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; as a personal inspiration. Remembering his early years in the United States, Schwarzenegger once said, &quot;I became a citizen of the United States when [Reagan] was president, and he is the first president I voted for as an American citizen. He inspired me and made me even prouder to be a new American.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His second term in office did not run as smoothly, however, as Schwarzenegger struggled to help the state through difficult financial times. After leaving office in January 2011, he sought to revive his career in the entertainment industry. In March of that year, Schwarzenegger announced plans to work with famed comic book creator &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biography.com/people/stan-lee-21101093&quot;&gt;Stan Lee&lt;/a&gt; on a new animated series inspired by his time in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return to Hollywood: \'The Expendables\' and \'Terminator\' Sequels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Schwarzenegger appeared alongside&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biography.com/people/sylvester-stallone-9491745&quot;&gt;Sylvester Stallone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biography.com/people/jason-statham&quot;&gt;Jason Statham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biography.com/people/jet-li-241077&quot;&gt;Jet Li&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biography.com/people/bruce-willis-9533244&quot;&gt;Bruce Willis&lt;/a&gt; in the ensemble action film &lt;i&gt;The Expendables&lt;/i&gt;. In August 2012, he reunited with the cast for &lt;i&gt;The Expendables 2.&lt;/i&gt; Just one week after the film\'s premiere, it had climbed to the No. 1 spot at the box office, bringing in nearly $28.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwarzenegger made headlines again later in 2012, when he admitted for the first time to having an affair with his&lt;i&gt; Red Sonja&lt;/i&gt; co-star, actress Brigitte Nielsen, in the mid-1980s, while he was dating and living with Maria Shriver. Nielsen had written about the adulterous relationship in her 2011 memoir, &lt;i&gt;You Only Get One Life&lt;/i&gt;, but Schwarzenegger didn\'t publicly confirm Nielsen\'s account until the fall of 2012, when his memoir, &lt;i&gt;Total Recall&lt;/i&gt;, was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing with his acting career, Schwarzenegger rejoined Stallone for &lt;i&gt;The Expendables 3&lt;/i&gt; in 2014. The following year he returned to the film franchise that made him a star with&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Terminator Genisys&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2017, Schwarzenegger replaced incoming president&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biography.com/people/donald-trump-9511238&quot;&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as host of NBC\'s reality show &lt;i&gt;The New Celebrity Apprentice, &lt;/i&gt;produced&amp;nbsp;by Mark Burnett. However, the show stumbled to low ratings and within a few months the actor announced that&amp;nbsp;he would not return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That year Schwarzenegger revealed that he was involved with a new Terminator film in the works. With the announcement that original co-star Linda Hamilton was also returning, buzz built ahead of the fall 2019 release of &lt;i&gt;Terminator: Dark Fate&lt;/i&gt;, though the big budget film ultimately disappointed with its opening weekend performance at the box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwarzenegger endured a health scare while&amp;nbsp;undergoing surgery for a catheter valve replacement at a Los Angeles hospital in March 2018. The valve replacement failed, resulting in&amp;nbsp;emergency open-heart surgery that proved successful. According to his spokesman,&amp;nbsp;Schwarzenegger was soon in stable condition, reportedly waking up with the words &quot;I\'m back,&quot; in a nod to his famous &lt;i&gt;Terminator&lt;/i&gt; character.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-03-23 15:36:12'),

What\'s the next job you\'d like to obtain? How do you hope your relationship improves? Identifying the importance of the goal can focus &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/attention&quot;&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt; and strengthen the motivation to accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divide the overarching goal into a series of small, specific, measurable tasks. Small goals are easier to accomplish, and checking each one off the list may invigorate you to keep going&mdash;as will the hit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/dopamine&quot;&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt; delivered after completing a task. Making items measurable also allows you to recognize and celebrate when each one is finished&mdash;and then move on to the next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goals should be calibrated at a precise level of difficulty. If the goal is too hard, you might be too intimidated to begin. If the goal is too easy, you might be too bored to finish. The optimal goal is slightly out of reach&mdash;it presents a challenge that&rsquo;s attainable. This concept is called the Goldilocks effect: People engage most with material at the precipice of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a plan to accomplish each small goal. Balance a realistic understanding of the challenges ahead with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/confidence&quot;&gt;confidence&lt;/a&gt; that you can overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONNECTED TOPICS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/habit-formation&quot;&gt;Habit Formation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/career&quot;&gt;Career&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/prescriptions-life/201310/lacking-motivation-and-inspiration-5-secrets-get-unstuck&quot;&gt;Lacking Motivation and Inspiration? 5 Secrets to Get Unstuck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/fostering-freedom/201910/how-generate-momentum&quot;&gt;How to Generate Momentum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What If I Lack Motivation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone feels demotivated or devoid of willpower at times. Even accomplishing a big goal can, paradoxically, lead to a listless lack of direction, as there\'s a sudden motivational void that needs to be filled, but no bullseye objective yet in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you\'re chronically unmotivated, or unable to begin a task that is of clear importance, several possibilities are in play. Your goals may need to be re-calibrated, usually because the task is too big or too amorphous and needs to be broken into smaller components, as discussed above. You may be experiencing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/burnout&quot;&gt;burnout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may lack confidence, rather than motivation, and are therefore afraid to proceed. Close in kin to a lack of confidence are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/perfectionism&quot;&gt;perfectionism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/procrastination&quot;&gt;procrastination&lt;/a&gt;. If you inherently doubt your ability to accomplish the task at hand, you may feel anxiously motivated but incapable of taking action. It is in the gap between motivation and execution that many forms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/self-sabotage&quot;&gt;self-sabotage&lt;/a&gt; and self-doubt lie, and it is important to identify what thought processes intercept the pipeline to goal achievement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/depression&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/conditions/persistent-depressive-disorder-dysthymia&quot;&gt;dysthymia&lt;/a&gt; can lead to a sense of apathy. In these cases, lack of motivation is a symptom of low mood. The anhedonia associated with depression reflects an inability to sustain interest over a period of time, because the neurocircuitry that regulates reward and motivation&mdash;pathways between the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens&mdash; are not working in tandem. If a lack of motivation is tied to anhedonia, other symptoms of depression may be present.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-03-23 15:43:01'),

So I&rsquo;ve decided to write out this article highlighting the &lt;strong&gt;10 most inspirational short stories&lt;/strong&gt; I&rsquo;ve heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next to the subheadings, in brackets, I&rsquo;ve put what the story&rsquo;s lesson is all about, with a short description of the moral of the story at the end of each section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.

They could easily have done so, but instead, they didn&rsquo;t try to at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious and wanting to know the answer, he asked a trainer nearby why the elephants were just standing there and never tried to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trainer replied;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&ldquo;when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it&rsquo;s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.&rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only reason that the elephants weren&rsquo;t breaking free and escaping from the camp was that over time they adopted the belief that it just wasn&rsquo;t possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the story:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how much the world tries to hold you back, always continue with the belief that what you want to achieve is possible.

The loan-shark was a very old, unattractive looking guy that just so happened to fancy the business owner&rsquo;s daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He decided to&amp;nbsp;offer the businessman a deal that would completely wipe out the debt he owed him. However, the catch was that we would only wipe out the debt if he could marry the businessman&rsquo;s daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this proposal was met with a look of disgust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The loan-shark said that he would place two pebbles into a bag, one white and one black.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daughter would then have to reach into the bag and pick out a pebble. If it was black, the debt would be wiped, but the loan-shark would then marry her. If it was white, the debt would also be wiped, but the daughter wouldn&rsquo;t have to marry the loan-shark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing on a pebble-strewn path in the businessman&rsquo;s garden, the loan-shark bent over and picked up two pebbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst he was picking them up, the daughter noticed that he&rsquo;d &lt;strong&gt;picked up two black pebbles&lt;/strong&gt; and placed them both into the bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He then asked the daughter to reach into the bag and pick one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daughter naturally had three choices as to what she could have done:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Refuse to&amp;nbsp;pick a pebble from the bag.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take both pebbles out of the bag and expose the loan-shark for cheating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick a pebble from the bag fully well knowing it was black and sacrifice herself for her father&rsquo;s freedom.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;She drew out a pebble from the bag, and before looking at it &lsquo;accidentally&rsquo; dropped it into the midst of the other pebbles. She said to the loan-shark;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&ldquo;Oh, how clumsy of me. Never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.&rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pebble left in the bag is obviously black, and seeing as the loan-shark didn&rsquo;t want to be exposed, he had to play along as if the pebble the daughter dropped was white, and clear her father&rsquo;s debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the story:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s always possible to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wealthygorilla.com/motivational-picture-quotes-get-through-hard-times/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;overcome a tough situation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; throughout of the box thinking, and not give in to the only options you think you have to pick from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.

That they would never make it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, one of the frogs took heed to what the others were saying and he gave up, falling down to his death.&amp;nbsp;The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Again, the crowd of frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and just die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He jumped even harder and finally made it out. When he got out, the other frogs said, &lt;strong&gt;&ldquo;Did you not hear us?&rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frog explained to them that he was deaf. He thought &lt;a href=&quot;https://thelife.com/19-ways-to-encourage-others&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;they were encouraging him&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the story:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People&rsquo;s words can have a big effect on other&rsquo;s lives. Think about what you say before it comes out of your mouth. It might just be the difference between life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.

One day the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he was getting the right amount, which he wasn&rsquo;t. Angry about this, he took the farmer to court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge asked the farmer if he was using any measure to weight the butter. The farmer replied, &ldquo;Honor, I am primitive. I don&rsquo;t have a proper measure, but I do have a scale.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge asked, &ldquo;Then how do you weigh the butter?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmer replied;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&ldquo;Your Honor, long before the baker started buying butter from me, I have been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when the baker brings the bread, I put it on the scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it is the baker.&rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the story:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In life, you get what you give.

He then hid himself and watched to see if anyone would move the boulder out of the way. Some of the king&rsquo;s wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people loudly blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear, but none of them did anything about getting the stone out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A peasant then came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to push the stone out of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the peasant went back to pick up his vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the King explaining that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the story:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every obstacle we come across in life gives us an &lt;a href=&quot;https://wealthygorilla.com/kobe-bryant-success-lessons/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;opportunity to improve our circumstances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and whilst the lazy complain, the others are creating opportunities through their kind hearts, generosity, and willingness to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.

He sat and watched the butterfly for several hours as it struggled to force its body through that little hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until it &lt;strong&gt;suddenly stopped making any progress&lt;/strong&gt; and looked like it was stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a pair of scissors and snipped off the remaining bit of the cocoon. The butterfly then emerged easily, although it had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man didn&rsquo;t think anything of it and sat there waiting for the wings to enlarge to support the butterfly. But that didn&rsquo;t happen. The butterfly spent the rest of its life unable to fly, crawling around with tiny wings and a swollen body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the &lt;strong&gt;kind heart of the man&lt;/strong&gt;, he didn&rsquo;t understand&amp;nbsp;that the restricting cocoon and the struggle needed by the butterfly to get itself through the small opening; were God&rsquo;s way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into its wings. To prepare itself for flying once it was out of the cocoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the story:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://wealthygorilla.com/21-greatest-arnold-schwarzenegger-quotes-remember/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;struggles in life develop our strengths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

His father decided to hand him a bag of nails and said&amp;nbsp;that every time the boy lost his temper, he had to hammer a nail into the fence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the first day, the boy hammered &lt;strong&gt;37 nails&lt;/strong&gt; into that fence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boy gradually began to &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifehacker.com/how-to-control-your-temper-before-you-lose-it-1698897376&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;control his temper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over the next few weeks, and the number of nails he was hammering into the fence slowly decreased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He discovered it was easier to control his temper than to hammer those nails into the fence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the day came when the boy didn&rsquo;t lose his temper at all. He told his father the news and the father suggested that the boy should now pull out a nail every day he kept his temper under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone.

The only person she didn&rsquo;t hate was her loving boyfriend, as he was always there for her. She said that if she could only see the world, she would marry him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, someone donated a pair of eyes to her &ndash; &lt;strong&gt;now she could see everything&lt;/strong&gt;, including her boyfriend. Her boyfriend asked her, &ldquo;now that you can see the world, will you marry me?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl was shocked when she saw that her boyfriend was blind too, and refused to marry him. Her boyfriend walked away in tears, and later wrote a letter to her saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&ldquo;Just take care of my eyes dear.&rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the story:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When our circumstances change, so does our mind. Some people may not be able to see the way things were before, and might not be &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.happify.com/hd/how-to-appreciate-what-you-have/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;able to appreciate them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Puppies for Sale (Understanding)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.wealthygorilla.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Puppies-for-Sale-Inspirational-Short-Stories.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Puppies for Sale (Inspirational Short Stories)&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.wealthygorilla.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Puppies-for-Sale-Inspirational-Short-Stories.jpg 580w, https://cdn.wealthygorilla.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Puppies-for-Sale-Inspirational-Short-Stories-450x191.jpg 450w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;580&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shop owner placed a sign above his door that said: &ldquo;Puppies For Sale.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs like this always have a way of attracting young children, and to no surprise, a boy saw the sign and approached the owner;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&ldquo;How much are you going to sell the puppies for?&rdquo; he asked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The store owner replied, &ldquo;Anywhere from $30 to $50.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little boy pulled out some change from his pocket. &ldquo;I have $2.37,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Can I please look at them?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shop owner smiled and whistled. Out of the kennel came Lady, who ran down the aisle of his shop followed by five teeny, tiny balls of fur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One puppy was lagging considerably behind. Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging, limping puppy and said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with that little dog?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shop owner explained that the veterinarian had examined the little puppy and had discovered it didn&rsquo;t have a hip socket. It would always limp. It would always be lame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The little boy became excited. &ldquo;That is the puppy that I want to buy.&rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shop owner said, &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t want to buy that little dog. If you really want him, I&rsquo;ll just give him to you.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little boy got quite upset. He looked straight into the store owner&rsquo;s eyes, pointing his finger, and said;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to give him to me. That little dog is worth every bit as much as all the other dogs and I&rsquo;ll pay full price. In fact, I&rsquo;ll give you $2.37 now, and 50 cents a month until I have him paid for.&rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shop owner countered, &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t want to buy this little dog. He is never going to be able to run and jump and play with you like the other puppies.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To his surprise, the little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace. He looked up at the shop owner and softly replied, &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t run so well myself, and the little puppy will need someone who understands!&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.

Money was tight and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, &ldquo;This is for you, Daddy.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man became embarrassed by his overreaction earlier, but his rage continue&amp;nbsp;when he saw that the box was empty. He yelled at her; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, when you give someone a present, there is supposed to be something inside?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and cried;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&ldquo;Oh, Daddy, it&rsquo;s not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They&rsquo;re all for you, Daddy.&rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he begged for her forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a short time later, an accident took the life of the child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her father kept the gold box by his bed for many years and, whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the story:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love is the most precious gift in the world.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-03-23 15:45:54');

We have created a line of contact.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the virus continuing&amp;nbsp;to spread, however, it is highly likely that the tournament will be impacted, though it is something that has to be monitored on a week-to-week basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Ivan Perry,&amp;nbsp;head of the School of Epidemiology and Public Health in University College Cork&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Ireland, suggested that a decision could potentially be made on Euro 2020 in the middle of May, depending on how things develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These decisions depend on a range of different factors,&quot; Professor Perry told &lt;strong&gt;Goal&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; at the beginning of March. &quot;Anyone who would speak with confidence about what we\'re going to do next month, never mind the middle of May or June, you can be pretty sure that they\'re not close to the fine-grained detail of the response to the&amp;nbsp;epidemic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: &quot;This is genuinely a novel virus, so we\'re actually learning more and more about the virus and how transmittable it is in symptomatic cases. We learn more information about that every day, but there\'s still&amp;nbsp;much that we don\'t know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;worst-case Euro 2020 scenario &lt;/strong&gt;is that UEFA is left with no choice but to &lt;strong&gt;cancel the tournament&lt;/strong&gt; completely. This would only transpire if authorities across Europe were unable to minimise the spread of Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such an outcome would affect thousands of people, with an entire network of planned interactions thrown into disorder, creating a hefty financial knock-on effect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only would the teams themselves have their plans disrupted, but so too would the supporters who intended to travel to the games, the businesses who planned for an influx of people to their cities and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postponing the Euros until a later date, such as June-July 2021, would have fewer financial ramifications but still leave many fans and businesses out of pocket, and cause disruption to the football schedule next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women\'s Euros is scheduled to take place in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/team/england/ck8m1cn23sukwsurgx5qakttk&quot;&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; from July 11-August 1, 2021. Back-to-back UEFA tournaments, where overlapping would seem likely, would be a logistical headache. But at least this way much of the investment and income for the upcoming Euros would just be delayed by a year, rather than abandoned entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WHOThailand&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO Thailandâœ”&lt;/strong&gt;@WHOThailand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formal declaration of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&quot;&gt;#COVID19&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/pandemic?src=hash&quot;&gt;#pandemic&lt;/a&gt; does not change the fact that you can - and should - take these simple steps to protect yourself and your loved ones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Watch and share this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WHO&quot;&gt;@WHO&lt;/a&gt; video!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/like?tweet_id=1237787926651535366&quot;&gt;4,170&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WHOThailand/status/1237787926651535366&quot;&gt;6:10 PM - Mar 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.twitter.com/articles/20175256&quot;&gt;Twitter Ads info and privacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WHOThailand/status/1237787926651535366&quot;&gt;4,024 people are talking about this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;better-case scenario &lt;/strong&gt;would see the games go ahead, but with restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, it could be that games will be&amp;nbsp;played behind closed doors, as has already happened with certain competitions in many countries that have been affected by Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring the games are played, albeit without a rapt audience in the stadiums, would not be ideal, but it would at least allow&amp;nbsp;the tournament to be fulfilled - keeping UEFA, TV broadcasters and football fans happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UEFA is preparing for all eight &lt;strong&gt;Euro 2020 play-off ties &lt;/strong&gt;to go ahead as normal at the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it has been suggested that some of the Euro 2020 play-off games may have to be played behind closed doors and the European governing body is understood to be ready for such an eventuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One has to be proportionate,&quot; says Professor Perry.&amp;nbsp;&quot;It would be&amp;nbsp;disproportionate, perhaps, at the moment to close down the London Underground based on the knowledge we currently have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whereas you could argue that it wouldn\'t be disproportionate that a match might be played in an empty stadium - it could be reasonable and proportionate - given where we are at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The situation changes&amp;nbsp;day-to-day and week-to-week basis and&amp;nbsp;it has to be reappraised on a day-by-day, week-by-week basis.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/news/coronavirus-vs-euro-2020-why-summer-tournament-is-in-grave/1dvq3vg2550ou1hwvgm6zh3b3z#top&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is Euro 2020 at risk of cancellation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Euro 2020 is at risk of cancellation because governments across the world are &lt;strong&gt;fighting to minimise the spread of Covid-19 &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;reduce the prospect of fatalities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staging a major sporting event across 12 cities in 12 different nations, as is the case with this edition of the UEFA European Championship,&amp;nbsp;would not be conducive to those efforts, particularly if things are not brought under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The first phase of the management of the epidemic is called \'containment\', where the focus is on minimising the spread of the index cases,&quot; explains Professor Perry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then there is a point where there is some spread within the community and you try to delay the peak of the epidemic to get as much time to be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The worst-case scenario is where you have a full scale pandemic&amp;nbsp;and that stage is called \'mitigation\', where you\'re looking after relatively large numbers of sick people. Most people will still be looked after at home, because they\'ll only have mild illness, but you\'ll have a small number who will need care at the hospital.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak &lt;strong&gt;began in December 2019 &lt;/strong&gt;in the &lt;strong&gt;Hubei region of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/team/china-pr/bur06vhektmgozn47md9dptk3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and, by mid-March, it has&amp;nbsp;spread across five continents, infecting over 150,000 people, with over 5,000 deaths worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/goal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goalâœ”&lt;/strong&gt;@goal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BREAKING: FIFA has recommended that &quot;all international matches previously scheduled to take place in March and April should now be postponed until such time that they can take place in a safe and secure environment, both for players and for the general public.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETBBdWUXgAEcysf?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=small&quot; alt=&quot;View image on Twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/like?tweet_id=1238561924633280514&quot;&gt;1,541&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/goal/status/1238561924633280514&quot;&gt;9:25 PM - Mar 13, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.twitter.com/articles/20175256&quot;&gt;Twitter Ads info and privacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/goal/status/1238561924633280514&quot;&gt;250 people are talking about this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mass movement and mass gathering of people&amp;nbsp;can contribute to a potentially dangerous upsurge in infections since people are at close quarters for prolonged periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Euro 2020 would ordinarily see hundreds of thousands of people&amp;nbsp;travelling to and from countries to watch games,&amp;nbsp;gathering in stadiums as well as public spaces, bars and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The concerns you\'d have relate to the fact that&amp;nbsp;if you have thousands of people, some of them will be asymptomatic carriers of the virus,&quot; says&amp;nbsp;Professor Perry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Those people will spread the virus through a crowd, who will then perhaps go home and transmit the virus to&amp;nbsp;someone in their environment who is particularly vulnerable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if UEFA wanted the&amp;nbsp;tournament to go&amp;nbsp;ahead without fans in stadia, there\'s a chance players will refuse to play at the risk of endangering their health and the health of their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/team/italy/eks08q2vbr45w563zrctsl5xo&quot;&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; has been Europe\'s worst-hit country so far and, following a quarantine of a quarter of Italy\'s population on&amp;nbsp;Saturday March 7, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/news/serie-a-players-threaten-to-strike-over-coronavirus-grave-threat-/1b6fqfsvnrcil1h69ix93bbzku&quot;&gt;Serie A\'s players union threatened to push for a strike due to &quot;grave threat to health&quot; concerns&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, a number of footballers playing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/serie-a/1r097lpxe0xn03ihb7wi98kao&quot;&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; for some of Italy\'s top clubs&amp;nbsp;were subsequently confirmed to have contracted the virus, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/news/coronavirus-football-teams-players-managers-owners-affected/1unrxo89q54201k0nt2pyru972&quot;&gt;cases have also been confirmed&lt;/a&gt; at clubs in the Premier League, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/primera-divisi%C3%B3n/34pl8szyvrbwcmfkuocjm3r6t&quot;&gt;La Liga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/bundesliga/6by3h89i2eykc341oz7lv1ddd&quot;&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the scale of the pandemic now - a global emergency - clubs have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/news/fifa-give-clubs-permission-to-decline-international-call-ups/dg68ypu5eff5zqj8399fje9o&quot;&gt;given the green light from FIFA&lt;/a&gt; to prevent their players from accepting international call-ups, which could be a source of disquiet for UEFA. Indeed, the Italian FA (FIGC) has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/news/we-will-propose-to-postpone-euro-2020-italian-fa-to-make/11i2n1ao8wx2ozhgzq7n5yo95&quot;&gt;called for a postponement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/news/coronavirus-vs-euro-2020-why-summer-tournament-is-in-grave/1dvq3vg2550ou1hwvgm6zh3b3z#top&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which Euro 2020 host nations are affected by coronavirus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in &lt;strong&gt;all 12 of the Euro 2020 host nations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italy is the &lt;strong&gt;worst-affected &lt;/strong&gt;country in Europe, which is particularly bad news for UEFA, considering that Rome is due to host the tournament\'s opening game between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/team/turkey/9s2kpeunkes0g17l95r3t91j6&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; and Italy on June 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Italy has been placed on lockdown, with the Italian government making it mandatory for citizens to remain at home while they attempt to deal with the crisis. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/team/spain/eh7yt2x2wck51oixw8012ux5j&quot;&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; followed Italy\'s lead in enacting a shutdown, while Ireland has mandated that pubs, restaurants and clubs be closed temporarily as part of a partial shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/team/germany/3l2t2db0c5ow2f7s7bhr6mij4&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; has&amp;nbsp;also seen a jump in the number of people infected by the virus, while Spain, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/team/netherlands/657oha8nkne1ybba2bouzkbo7&quot;&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and the UK have&amp;nbsp;reported hundreds of infections too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/team/denmark/akblgvrthxxgta4ou9lnslxgb&quot;&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, Azerbaijan, Ireland, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/team/russia/f0frccyrlq2jjihdraoie2e2d&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, Romania and Hungary have relatively lower numbers of recorded cases as of mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 12, the Irish government announced that a partial shutdown - closing of&amp;nbsp;schools, nurseries and universities, as well as some limits on public gatherings -&amp;nbsp;would be enforced until March 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/news/coronavirus-vs-euro-2020-why-summer-tournament-is-in-grave/1dvq3vg2550ou1hwvgm6zh3b3z#top&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/news/coronavirus-football-sports-covid-19-outbreak/vtp4lgjaoomu11k2khp522d2m&quot;&gt;Are other major sporting events being cancelled?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Euro 2020 is&amp;nbsp;not the only major sporting event in 2020&amp;nbsp;under threat of cancellation due to coronavirus concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo is another large-scale tournament which involves global participation - from competitors, sports fans, media organisations and so on - which has been queried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is scheduled to begin six weeks&amp;nbsp;later than Euro 2020, though, towards the end of July, which means that there is slightly more time available to organisers to set about planning for all potential outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has been defiant in its assessment of the situation, maintaining that the Olympics will not be cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IOC president Thomas Bach said in March that the committee &quot;will not get caught in speculation&quot; with regard to what might happen in the intervening months, noting that it is a case of \'business as usual\'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there has evidently been some consideration of the possibility of cancellation or postponement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Torch Relay, which is a powerfully symbolic event for the Olympics, has been scaled back in response to the spread of the virus, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goal.com/en/team/japan/6duaxcbrofil112qfq4v895go&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;\'s Olympics minister Seiko Hashimoto has suggested the events could be held later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-03-23 15:51:29');
